My AVR Assembly Archives   
Some of my old AVR assembly projects.  

AVR assebly programming was fun and productive for the past.  
However, it was limited at some levels and too hard to handle some complicated projects.     
  
Today, it turned out to be advanced programming features on Arduino Sketch for high performance, minimized codes and accurate timing.
